   Does life ever feel pointless and like everday is just going through the same old motions? I'm here to tell you that I understand. I feel this daily. Let's become friends as we navigate these hard and confusing times together.

 <div id="surrendering"> 
    Before we can live for God we have to surrender our current lives to him. We have to talk to him, give him our burdens, and entrust him with our doubts and concerns.

</div>
</body>
    <p>

    I'm going to pray for you real quick: Lord, I thank you for my friend reading this right now. I pray over their journey and their walk with you. I pray protection and healing over their beautiful broken heart. I pray peace over their minds. I pray you would calm the storm of anxiety that comes with all the chaos of life. I pray you would give them the strength to lift their eyes and fix them on you. And I pray you would fight every battle that comes their way. In Jesus mighty name I pray, amen.
    </p>

    These verses make me feel like God is sitting beside me, wrapping his arms around me, and saying "I'm here honey. Everything will get better. I haven't left you and I would never dream of it. You are mine and I love you dearly." 

</div>

 I want to give you a hug now, but I can't teleport, so let's pretend this is you and me.

Let's look at how we can live like Jesus.

    All Christians strive to have the perfect godly life, but what does it really take to get there? In reality we can't actually be perfect but we can make it our priority to be like Christ. Practicing being like Jesus isn't easy; you have to give up a lot because Christ gave up everything even His own life, so we could live. The only way we can truly improve our way of life is by listening to God and following Christ's example. When we submit to God's Word, obey His teachings, and live by what the Bible teaches, we are engaging in Christian practices for a godly life.



Submitting to God's Word means surrendering your ways to Him and admitting you need guidance. To move onto the next step you first have to read the Bible. You have to study it and understand it before you can apply it to your daily lives. Filling your heart and mind with Truth leaves no room for sin and thoughts that are not from Him. We can trust the Bible because it comes from Him, and we must take advantage of the Truth and guidance He gave us through it. 



Once we know the Word and have hidden it in our heart we can start to apply it our life and use it as a weapon. The Bible is there for us to obey. It is filled with wisdom and knowledge; laws and expectations; and true stories of real people, real faith, and real struggles. The saying is true especially when talking about your faith in God that actions speak louder than words. Making empty promises to God about obeying him is worthless compared to fulfilling the tasks he asks of us.



Last but certainly not least is living God's Word. Once we understand it and obey it we will start looking different to people, a "glow-up" if you will. To live like Him is to love like him; you have a calling on your life but until it's time to answer the calling you have an objective to love others and bring them to Christ. You plant seeds in peoples' lives when you show Jesus and tell of him and of what he has done for you and them. It's not always easy to live His Word; you will face trials, hardship, and rejection; but it's worth the eternal treasure.

</p>

Engaging in Christian practices for a godly life looks like submitting to God's Word, obeying His teachings, and living God's Word. Submitting is the first step because how can you obey something you don't trust? The only way to improve is by obeying the Truth. We can't say we are Christians and then turn around and live sinful lives. Is there anything you need to work on improving in your relationship with Christ?
