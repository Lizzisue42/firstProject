   Does life ever feel pointless and like everday is just going through the same old motions? I'm here to tell you that I understand. I feel this daily. Let's become friends as we navigate these hard and confusing times together.

 <div id="surrendering"> 
    Before we can live for God we have to surrender our current lives to him. We have to talk to him, give him our burdens, and entrust him with our doubts and concerns.


    I'm going to pray for you real quick: Lord, I thank you for my friend reading this right now. I pray over their journey and their walk with you. I pray protection and healing over their beautiful broken heart. I pray peace over their minds. I pray you would calm the storm of anxiety that comes with all the chaos of life. I pray you would give them the strength to lift their eyes and fix them on you. And I pray you would fight every battle that comes their way. In Jesus mighty name I pray, amen.

    These verses make me feel like God is sitting beside me, wrapping his arms around me, and saying "I'm here honey. Everything will get better. I haven't left you and I would never dream of it. You are mine and I love you dearly."

 I want to give you a hug now, but I can't teleport, so let's pretend this is you and me.
