<h1>Paragraph Practice</h1>

<p> There was a snail called Herbert who was so very slow. He caused a lot of traffic jams wherever he would go. The ants were always getting mad, and the beetles they would fume. Herb would only poke along and sing a little tune.

<p> When Herbert was much younger, he often got in trouble. Forgetting that he was a snail, he did things on the double. He'd crash through every spider web and with crickets he'd collide. Until one day Herbert's father took his speeding son aside

<p> There's a moral to this tale. Some of you may find yourselves behind a creeping snail. So if you are impatient and are easily disturbed, think about this little song and take a tip from Herb.
